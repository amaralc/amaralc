### Hi there 👋

- 💻 I'm currently working as a front end web developer, creating user interfaces with 3D data visualization features that enable engineers and vibration specialists to interact and analyse data generated by Dynaloggers (sensors) from [Dynamox](https://dynamox.net/).
- 🔭 In the mean time I develop a platform for university laboratories at [@peerlab-devs](https://github.com/peerlab-devs) as well as finish my masters degree at [@lmp-ufsc-br](https://github.com/lmp-ufsc-br).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js and Three.js in order to create 3D visualizations in SSR websites. I am also interested in learning more about microfrontends, module federation, WebAssembly and Rust, in order to solve architecture and performance issues in different projects.
